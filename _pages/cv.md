<span class="entry-description"><strong>Junior Robotics Software Engineer</strong> at <strong>Gideon Brothers</strong>, Zagreb, Croatia
<br />During my time at Gideon Brothers I worked on two bigger projects.
My first assignment was to review optical flow approaches and evaluate their
potential for use on autonomous mobile robots. Afterward, I worked on developing
a centralized system for coordinating heterogeneous fleet of autonomous robots.

    <strong>Merging statistically similar regions</strong><br />
    Contemporary approaches for semantic segmentation use deep neural networks
    and achieve amazing results. Instead of using DNNs for segmenenting images,
    in this seminar I explore and expand on an algorithm for merging
    statistically similar regions, usually applied on grayscale images, applied
    on RGB images.
