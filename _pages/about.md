<p class="h2">FAQ</p>

**What is the motivation behind the name *Finding Intuition*?** &nbsp; &nbsp;
There is a difference between the verbs *to look (for)* and *to find*. In simple
terms, *finding something* is the result of *looking for something*. In that
sense, the title of the blog reflects that continuing act of finally arriving
at *the last piece of the puzzle*, *a new perspective on the a concept*
that resolves any remaining confusion or misunderstanding.

**Do you update your old posts?** &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, I do. Since English is
not my first language, I'll update my posts whenever I see or get notified of a
badly written sentence. Sometimes I'll misspell a word or have bad grammar, and,
on other occasions, I might find a better explanation for some part of the post.

**Where can I find CV template?** &nbsp; &nbsp; I used [MarkDeep](https://casual-effects.com/morgan/cv.md.html)'s CV template and design.
